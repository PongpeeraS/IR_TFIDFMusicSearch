And from the first time that she really done me  
Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Everybody hurts, sometimes
And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  
You would not believe your eyes  if ten million fireflies
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
